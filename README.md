### 📝 Personal Statement

I have lived in Norway for the past seven years (two years in Oslo and five years in Trondheim). Recently I bought a small house in Fannrem – a small charming village with maximum 1500 residents (probably half of them are cows!). I enjoy reading and have a collection of over 100 books at home, which reflects my curiosity and love for continuous learning. I also learned to ski last year and am practicing more. I am socially very active, easily build connections and value teamwork. Originally from India, but I have embraced Norwegian culture by learning the language (passed B1 level test).
